There's absolutely no reason I'm doing this website now. Nope. I'm definitely not coding this to avoid my other coding obligations. *And it's definitely not because I initiated a portfolio review and feedback session for everyone at Artifex in two weeks, nope.*

I'm going to preface this with saying I'll need the following list of items, and I'll use this as my ~~shit~~ to-do list for the day:

- [x] Navigation
- [x] Site pages (home, about, writing, lab, work)
- [x] Article search
- [x] Home page: spiffy ~~glitchy~~ watery effects
- Writing:
    - [x]Generated of articles sorted by date
    - [x] Topic tags in each post
    - [x] Filterable list (by category)
    - [x] Individual article pages
    - [x] Individual tag pages
    - [x] Markdown image support
    - [x] Video support
- Lab:
    - For now, just a gallery of projects (work or otherwise, doesn't matter)
    - [x] Each item should link to a post (markdown), which supports video and gifs
    - Grid layout
    - Gif and video featured images
    - For later, I want this to look like some of 3D space... Maybe
- CV:
    - [x] Coded version of my CV
    - [x] CV data should be stored in JSON
    - [x] Options: Developer CV, Designer CV
    - [x]  Save as PDF for CV
    - Web version can be slightly different
    - [x] Pop-ups that show content in markdown of CV items

Aaaand I'm gonna fiddle with the CSS and styling last because that takes me f o r e v e r. 

I decided to try to take inspiration from the following Bruce Lee quote instead of the whole Cyberpunk aesthetic I'm currently obsessed with:

> Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless â€” like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.

I had that version on my previous website as well. I feel like it's a great metaphor for responsive and accessible web design as well as human development:

> Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. 

I'm *so* going to animate that in CSS or something one day.

Anyway: I have fourteen days. Let's get to it!
