So far I've managed to:
- Build out the general structure.
- Handle *responsive* navigation. I learnt something new about using states (React Hooks) for swapping classes out for responsive menus. That'll be something I can update in my other projects.
- Add Markdown support to this Gatsby site.
- Generate the list of journal articles.
- Generate tag pages based on tags.

More on some of these discoveries soon in separate posts!
