This is also happening in two parts, mainly because of the amount of time I spent asleep. :D I'll keep telling myself that I'm still on a good routine...

Everything piling up from day 6:

- [x] Finish styling the CV web page (responsive).
- [x] Have some text show in the button download area indicating that a CV can actually be downloaded.
- [x] Add collapsible content for All.
- [x] For Dev/Designer, limit the number of experience and project items.
- [x] Add analytics.
- [x] Add gif support.

And everything from Day 4 (edited):

- [x] 'All tags' page template.
- [x] Tag template page styling.
- [x] 'All posts' category button does not return to active state.
- [x] Footer needs more top margin?
- [x] Navigation needs a background colour.
- [x] Add social media...

And everything from today:
- [x] Navigation background colour should fade in on scroll.
- [x] None of the writing category buttons have hover states.
- [x] Change navigation icon to something thinner.
- [x] Style that mobile menu because you forgot about it.
- [x] Mobile testing (ya girl should've styled mobile-first, honestly... But I was so excited. :( )
- [x] Fix main name text on homepage for phones.

Turns out I may not output the best front-end code, but I no longer need internet to get a shit ton done, and I remember more than I give myself credit for.

*Ayyyyyy.*

I had to cut off my ever-growing list of things:
- Interactive gifs for accessibility reasons.
- A scroll to top button (I don't have long enough content yet to warrant one).
- Add page switching between posts (will be useful for posts in a series, especially tutorials).
- Design and implement CV popups - although I'd already implemented the modal windows, I'm not entirely sure how I want everything to work, or if it's even worth my time collating that much information.
- Move post tags to the bottom of a post template.
- Figure out the whole deal with CV vs portfolio. Portfolios are about best work, and CVs list everything. I am better off creating them separately instead of making my CV interactive? Ho-hum.
