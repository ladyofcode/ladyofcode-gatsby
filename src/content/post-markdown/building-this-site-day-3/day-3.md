Wrapping up functionality (hindsight: or so I thought):
- Integrated markdown files into modal windows for the interactive CV page (why am I making this interactive whyyyyyy).
- Added the designer/dev switching functionality to the interactive CV page.
- The CV can also be downloaded as a PDF that'll be generated for every new version of the CV.
- Video support for featured images and inline posts.
