Today I've added:
- A search function to the writing section. Thought I was getting some weird bug that was actually my own tags showing up. >_>
- A clickable filter buttons to filter the posts. This was a nightmare. :')
- The Lab section, with markdown files in a separate folder. Deciding to use ternary operators for page generation was awesome. #proud
- Image support for inline images and featured lab items.
- All of my CV data in a JSON file, and imported it into the page template.

I was hoping to get all of the functionality done tonight so I could leave the weekend to styling but no. Such. Luck.

Damn, if I could get this site up in 5 days... Maybe one day I'll be good enough where it'd take me 1-2 days tops.
